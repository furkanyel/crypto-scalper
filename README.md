## 💡 Best Practices for 5-Minute Crypto Scalping

### 1. Timeframe Optimization
- **Primary Timeframe**: 5-minute charts (optimized for this indicator)
- **Confirmation Timeframe**: Check 15-minute chart for trend alignment
- **Higher Timeframe**: Review 1-hour chart for overall market direction

### 2. Market Conditions
- **Best Performance**: High volatility markets with clear trends
- **Avoid**: Low volume periods, major news releases without proper risk management
- **Trading Hours**: Most active during overlapping market sessions

### 3. Entry Strategy
- **Wait for Confirmation**: Ensure the candle closes with the signal
- **Volume Confirmation**: Higher volume signals are generally more reliable
- **Trend Alignment**: Stronger signals when aligned with higher timeframe trends

### 4. Exit Strategy
- **Take Profit**: Use support/resistance levels, or 1:2 risk/reward ratio minimum
- **Stop Loss**: Place below recent swing low (buy) or above recent swing high (sell)
- **Trailing Stop**: Consider using a trailing stop to lock in profits
- **Opposite Signal**: Exit when opposite signal appears

### 5. Risk Management (CRITICAL)
- **Position Size**: Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital per trade
- **Stop Loss**: ALWAYS use stop losses - no exceptions
- **Risk/Reward**: Aim for minimum 1:2 ratio (risk $1 to make $2)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Set a maximum daily loss limit (e.g., 5% of capital)
- **Avoid Overtrading**: Quality over quantity - don't force trades

### 6. Market Selection
- **High Liquidity Pairs**: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, etc.
- **Avoid Low Volume**: Pairs with low volume can have false signals
- **Volatility**: This indicator works best with moderate to high volatility

### 7. False Signal Reduction
- **Multiple Timeframe Analysis**: Confirm signals on higher timeframes
- **Market Structure**: Trade in the direction of the overall trend
- **Support/Resistance**: Signals near key levels are more reliable
- **Volume Profile**: Higher volume at signal points increases reliability

## ⚠️ Risk Management Recommendations

### Position Sizing
```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk Percentage) / Stop Loss Distance

Example:
- Account Size: $10,000
- Risk Per Trade: 1% = $100
- Entry: $50,000
- Stop Loss: $49,500
- Stop Loss Distance: $500

Position Size = $100 / $500 = 0.002 BTC (or equivalent)
```

### Stop Loss Placement
- **Buy Signals**: Place stop loss 1-2 ATR below entry or below recent swing low
- **Sell Signals**: Place stop loss 1-2 ATR above entry or above recent swing high
- **Never Move Stop Loss** in the wrong direction (against your position)

### Take Profit Targets
1. **Conservative**: 1:1 Risk/Reward (take profit at same distance as stop loss)
2. **Moderate**: 1:2 Risk/Reward (recommended minimum)
3. **Aggressive**: 1:3 Risk/Reward (hold for larger moves)

### Portfolio Risk
- **Maximum Open Positions**: 3-5 positions simultaneously
- **Correlation**: Avoid multiple correlated pairs (e.g., don't trade BTC/USDT and BTC/EUR simultaneously)
- **Capital Allocation**: Don't use more than 10-15% of capital on scalping

## 📝 Backtesting Notes

### Recommended Testing Approach
1. **Historical Data**: Test on at least 3-6 months of historical data
2. **Different Market Conditions**: Include bull, bear, and sideways markets
3. **Multiple Assets**: Test on various cryptocurrency pairs
4. **Paper Trading**: Practice with paper trading before using real money

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades (aim for >50%)
- **Average Risk/Reward**: Should be at least 1:2
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / Gross loss (aim for >1.5)
- **Expectancy**: (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss) (should be positive)

### Known Limitations
- **Choppy Markets**: May generate false signals in ranging, low-volatility conditions
- **News Events**: Major news can cause whipsaws - avoid trading during high-impact news
- **Gaps**: Crypto markets are 24/7, but exchange outages can cause gaps
- **Slippage**: Fast-moving markets may result in slippage on entry/exit

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Signal Not Appearing
- Ensure all four conditions are met simultaneously
- Check that volume is above average
- Verify the indicator is applied to the correct timeframe (5-minute)

### Too Many Signals
- Increase RSI overbought/oversold levels (e.g., 75/25)
- Increase Bollinger Bands standard deviation (e.g., 2.5)
- Use longer EMA periods (e.g., 12/26)

### Too Few Signals
- Decrease RSI overbought/oversold levels (e.g., 65/35)
- Decrease Bollinger Bands standard deviation (e.g., 1.5)
- Use shorter EMA periods (e.g., 5/13)

### Alerts Not Working
- Ensure you've created the alert (see Installation Step 4)
- Check TradingView notification settings
- Verify you have an active TradingView subscription (alerts may be limited on free plans)
